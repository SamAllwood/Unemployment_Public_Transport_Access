### Unemployment and Public Transport Job Accessibility (PTJA)
MSc Urban Transport at Uni of Glasgow. Dissertation project on relationship between unemployment and public transport job accessibility in Greater Manchester. Any questions, please let me know!

### Public Transport Job Accessibility (Demand-adjusted)
Public transport job accessibility distribution for an area calculated by summing the numbers of jobs decayed according to travel time by public transport to their location. Travel time matrix calculated using [R5R, Rapid Realistic Routing algorithm for multi-model transit journeys](https://github.com/ipeaGIT/r5r).
